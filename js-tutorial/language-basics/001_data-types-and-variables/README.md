### Data types:

- Undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, bigint and Object.

### Variable:

- var, let (preferred way) and const

### Note:

- Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

- Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example: `Hello, ${name}!`
