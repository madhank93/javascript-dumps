### Data types:

- Undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, bigint and Object.

### Variable:

- var, let (preferred way) and const

### Note:

- Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

- Back ticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example: `Hello, ${name}!`

### Data types

-   Primitive data types:

    -   Numbers - Integers, floats
    -   Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
    -   Booleans - true or false value
    -   Null - empty value or no value
    -   Undefined - a declared variable without a value
    -   Bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.

-   Non-primitive data types:

    -   Objects
    -   Functions
    -   Arrays
